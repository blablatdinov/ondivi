This is a simple Python script designed to filter coding violations (likely identified by a static analyzer) for only the lines that have been changed in a Git repository.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

## Installation

```bash
pip install ondivi
```

## Usage

Ensure you are in the root directory of your Git repository.

Run the script:

```bash
flake8 script.py | ondivi
```

Flake8 on file:

```bash
$ flake8
file.py:3:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
file.py:9:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
file.py:10:121: E501 line too long (123 > 120 characters)
file.py:14:1: E305 expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found 1
```

Define changed lines with `git diff`

```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/file.py b/file.py
index 2b63c84..7589f73 100644
--- a/file.py
+++ b/file.py
@@ -11,0 +12 @@ def greet(user: User):
+    print('Long string in new commit ################################################################################')
@@ -14,0 +16 @@ if __name__ == '__main__':
+    greet(User('Bob', '23'))
```

```bash
$ flake8 script.py | ondivi
file.py:12:80: E501 line too long (119 > 79 characters)
```

```bash
ondivi --help
```

```
Usage: ondivi [OPTIONS]

  Ondivi (Only diff violations).

  Python script filtering coding violations, identified by static analysis,
  only for changed lines in a Git repo. Usage example:

  flake8 script.py | ondivi

Options:
  --baseline=BASELINE   Commit or branch which will contain legacy code.
                        Program filter out violations on baseline (default:
                        "master")
  --format=VIOLATION_FORMAT
                        Template for parsing linter messages. The template
                        should include the following named parts:  {filename}
                        The name of the file with the error/warning {line_num}
                        The line number with the error/warning (integer)
                        Example usage: --format
                        "{filename}:{line_num:d}{other}"  In this example, the
                        linter message "src/app_types/listable.py:23:1: UP035
                        Import from `collections.abc` instead: `Sequence`"
                        will be recognized and parsed into the following
                        components:   - filename: "src/app_types/listable.py"
                        - line_num: 23   - other: :1: UP035 Import from
                        `collections.abc` instead: `Sequence`"  Ensure that
                        the template matches the format of the messages
                        generated by your linter.  (default:
                        "{filename}:{line_num:d}{other}")
  --only-violations     Show only violations
  --help                Show this message and exit.
```

## How it Works

The script parses the Git diff output to identify the changed lines in each file.

It then filters the given coding violations to include only those violations that correspond to the changed lines.
